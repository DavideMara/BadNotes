# 1.2-2 Evolution

### 1950's - 60's
**Wide Area Network (WAN)** --> Type of network that cover a large geographycal area, it's operated by service providers

**Switching** --> Switching mechanism that establishes a dedicated path through the network's nodes 

### 1970's 

**Standard ITU** --> Intentoinal Telecommunication Union

#### PACKET SWITCHING 

Mechanism in which data is sent in sequences, divide into small unit (packets) of data

Each packet is passed node to node

// formula Vt//

#### X25

It's a packet switching mechanism that, at every hop, verify the correctness of each packet. And if it's necessary, it's forwarded from one node to the next until it arrives correctly.

--> + complexity of the project + monetary cost
--> 64 kbps MAX

## Example 
This network use a mechanism of flow regulation (buffer)
