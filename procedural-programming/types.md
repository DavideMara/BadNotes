# Types

In the C language object refers to a location in the memory whose contents can represent values.

Objects that have names are also called variables.

## Object type

We can understand the type of object by 3 principal characteristics

| How much space occupies in memory | Values that a variable can have | The operation that can be performed on that variable |
| --- | --- | --- |

The types that exist are the following ones :

- Basic Type
    
    [Integers](Types/Integers%20d4ae31080cee42bf92559d2531d2cb91.md)
    
    [Floating Point](Types/Floating%20Point%202ecada2499194d61a91a318db7ef7d66.md)
    
- Derived Types
    
    Pointer Types
    
    Array Types
    
    Structure Types
    
    Union Types
    
    Function Types
    

[Enumerated Types](Types/Enumerated%20Types%20183c3990dfea806289a2e4003ca730c2.md)

[Type Void](Types/Type%20Void%20183c3990dfea803a8dc3cb4ac0acc202.md)

The `basic types` and the `enumerated types` **together** make up the `arithmetic types`

The `arithmetic types` and the `pointer types` **together** are called `Scalar types`

The `array types` and the `pointer type` are referred as the `aggregate types`

A `function type` describes the interface to a function; that is, it specifies the type of the function’s return value, also the types of all the parameters that are passed to the function when it is called.
